Overall, your introduction and problem statement are clear and concise. You have also identified the dataset you will be using and provided a data dictionary for the variables. Additionally, you have also included a checklist for Linear Regression which is a good practice.

One suggestion would be to provide more information on the "success criteria metrics" section. You have defined R2 and RMSE as the metrics, but it would be helpful to provide a specific target value or range for these metrics that would indicate a "successful" model.

Another thing to consider is that, you are only considering the conspicuous consumption features while fitting the model, but it is also important to consider other features that may also be influential in determining the market value of a house.

Also, it would be good to mention what you plan on doing with the data, after you have performed the analysis. For example, you might want to explain how you will use the results of your analysis to help the Airbnb investor make their decision.

Finally, it would be helpful to provide a rough outline of your plan for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection and model building.

It looks like you've done a good job of explaining the data cleaning and EDA steps, including the problem of missing values, correlated features, and outliers. It would be helpful to include the actual code for the data cleaning and EDA steps, as well as the specific values for the success criteria metrics you mentioned (R2 score and RMSE score) that you want to achieve. Also, it would be good to explain how you will validate the model, such as using cross-validation or a holdout set.
